# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of my personal work including data visualizations using Power BI app, diagrams using draw.io, and some research work.

## How to View/Run These Projects
- For all attachments that end with .pbix, please open them in Power BI Desktop.
- For all attachments that end with .drawio, please open them in the [draw.io tool](https://app.diagrams.net/).
- For all other attachments use your most appropriate tool for .pdf or .xlsx documents.

Feel free to explore my projects and provide feedback!
